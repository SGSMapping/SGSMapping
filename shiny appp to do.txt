Things to do:
-  connect script and .csv waypoint file from github to the shiny app host
- replace section end points with polylines of the survey sections
- associate waypoints to each polyline for later metic calculations such as redds per km surveyed
	- not sure we want to move any of the waypoints to the line or leave them at their unadjusted waypoint coordinates
- jitter waypoints with same coordinates so each are visible as a single waypoint
- add export map button to map
- add in multiple tabs
	- tab 1: map
	- tab 2: table of mapped waypoints
	- tab 3: analytics menu = metrics and figures to be exported
